## Introduction

In this lab, we analyze a captured WPA handshake (`wpa.cap`) to demonstrate the process of cracking a Wi-Fi password using dictionary-based attacks. WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access) secures wireless networks using pre-shared keys. However, if an attacker captures the 4-way handshake, the password can be brute-forced using a wordlist.

## 1. WPA Handshake

Before attempting to crack the password, it's essential to confirm that the `.cap` file contains a valid WPA 4-way handshake. We use `tshark` to inspect the capture file for EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) packets, which are part of the handshake process.

run the command: `tshark -r wpa.cap -Y "eapol"`

This filters the packet capture for only EAPOL packets. The output shows the messages exchanged between the access point and the  client device:

From the screenshot above, at least 3 of the 4 required EAPOL packets (`Message 1`, `2`, and `3`). This confirms that the WPA handshake has been successfully captured, and we can go ahead and try to crack the password.

## 2. Extract the BSSID

We need the BSSID (MAC address) of the access point (AP) that sent the beacon frames. This helps `aircrack-ng` target the correct network during the brute-force process.

```bash
Run the command:  tshark -r wpa.cap -Y "wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08" -T fields -e wlan.bssid
```


* `-r wpa.cap`: Reads the capture file.
* `-Y "wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08"`: Filters for beacon frames which advertise networks.
* `-T fields -e wlan.bssid`: Extracts the BSSID field from those frames.

`00:0d:93:eb:b0:8c`: This is the BSSID of the target Wi-Fi access point. We will use this MAC address when running  `aircrack-ng` to crack the password.


## 3.Cracking the WPA Password with `aircrack-ng`

With the handshake verified and the BSSID extracted, we can now attempt to brute-force the WPA2 password using `aircrack-ng` and a wordlist.

```bash
Run the command: aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b 00:0d:93:eb:b0:8c wpa.cap
```


* `-w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` : specifies the wordlist (`rockyou.txt`) used to try possible passwords.
* `-b 00:0d:93:eb:b0:8c`: targets the access point identified by its BSSID (MAC address).
* `wpa.cap` : the capture file containing the WPA handshake.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Tips

To protect wireless networks from attacks like WPA handshake capture and password cracking, the following best practices should be implemented:

### 🔑 1. Use Strong, Complex Passwords
Avoid common passwords that appear in public wordlists (like `rockyou.txt`). A secure WPA2 password should:
- Be at least **12–16 characters**
- Include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid dictionary words or personal information

### 🔄 2. Rotate Wi-Fi Credentials Periodically
Change Wi-Fi passwords regularly, especially after employee turnover or suspicious activity.

### 🛰️ 3. Use WPA3 Where Possible
Upgrade your hardware to support **WPA3**, which offers stronger protection against offline dictionary attacks using **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**.

### 🚫 4. Monitor for Rogue Devices & Deauth Attacks
Use wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) to detect:
- Repeated deauthentication frames
- Rogue access points mimicking your SSID
- Suspicious MAC addresses attempting handshake captures

### 📶 5. Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
WPS is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and should be disabled on all routers and access points.

### 🧰 6. Employ Network Segmentation
Separate your wireless networks (e.g., guest vs. internal) to limit exposure in case of compromise.

_Implementing these practices significantly reduces the risk of Wi-Fi password cracking and strengthens your network's overall security posture._

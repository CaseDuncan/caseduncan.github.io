## What Is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of code injection attack where an attacker manipulates SQL queries by inserting malicious SQL statements into input fields such as login forms or search bars. If the application doesnâ€™t properly validate user input, it may unintentionally execute these malicious commands.
